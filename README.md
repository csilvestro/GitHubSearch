I have not used Github API. I feel like I completely over thought it.  I have been using apis for a very long time. Not so much with axios. I use postman and others.  I have a very good memory. If I see it once I can normally remember the syntax. I have the ablitly to learn your procedure. Show me once and I can replacate it on all apps. This is why I want to be hired for your company. I want to see how other people write their code and be part of a team.
